# Design Pattern Collection Implementation

## Strategy Pattern

In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern)
is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime.
Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives run-time instructions
as to which in a family of algorithms to use.

## Observer Pattern

The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, 
maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of 
any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
